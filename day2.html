            The long held belief was that Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, the geeky teenagers who invented Superman in the 1930s, dreamed up the powerful hero as a way to attract girls at their Ohio high school.
            But now it is appears that personal tragedy rather than a quest to win over their peers could be the real story behind Superman's birth.
            On June 2, 1932, Jerry Siegel's father Mitchell, a Jewish immigrant from Lithuania, died during a night-time robbery at his Cleveland second hand clothes store.
            The 60-year-old fell to the ground during the robbery. According to the police report, gunshots were heard. Siegel's family and the coroner, however, said he died of a heart attack.
            Was it the sudden loss of his father that pushed a distraught 17-year-old to invent a bullet-proof super-being to avenge evil and fight for good?
            That's the theory of best-selling author Brad Meltzer, who researched Mitchell Siegel's death for his new novel, The Book of Lies, in which he draws parallels between Siegel's "murder" and another "true" mystery, the killing of Abel by his brother Cain.
            "In 50 years of interviews, Jerry Siegel never once mentioned that his father died in a robbery," Mr Meltzer told USA Today.
            "But think about it. Your father dies in a robbery, and you invent a bulletproof man who becomes the world's greatest hero. I'm sorry, but there's a story there."
            Although Superman did not appear in print until 1938 on the cover of Action Comics, writer Jerry Siegel and artist Shuster originally came up with the character, first dubbed The Superman, six years earlier, "just weeks after Jerry Siegel's father was killed ", Mr Meltzer writes on his website.
            In one of the oldest surviving sketches, Superman rushes to the rescue of a man being held up by a masked robber.
            "America did not get Superman from our greatest legends, but because a boy lost his father," Mr Meltzer said. "Superman came not out of our strength but out of our vulnerability."
            The author, who interviewed Jerry Siegel's family and researched newspapers from 1932, was stunned to find a letter published in The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer on June 3, 1932, the day after the robbery, weighing in on the topic of the need for vigilantes during the dark days of the Depression. The letter is signed by an A.L. Luther.
            "Is that where (Superman's arch enemy) Lex Luthor came from?" Mr Meltzer said. "I almost had a heart attack right there. I thought, 'You have to be kidding me!' "
            Others have also probed Superman's origins. Gerard Jones, a comic book historian who in 2004 first wrote about the Siegel robbery in his book Men of Tomorrow: Geeks, Gangsters and the Birth of the Comic Book, is convinced it "had to have an effect" on Jerry.
            "Superman's invulnerability to bullets, loss of family, destruction of his homeland" all seem to overlap with Jerry's personal experience," Mr Jones told USA Today. "There's a connection there: the loss of a dad as a source for Superman."
            There is no chance of Siegel or Shuster explaining the true origins of the Man of Steel. Both have died, Shuster in 1992 and Siegel in 1996.
            It took them several years to sell their creation. When they did, they received only a cheque for 130 dollars in exchange for handing DC Comics the rights to the character "forever".
            Over the years they staged numerous legal attempts to win back the rights as Superman became increasingly lucrative for his owners, failing but being awarded financial settlements. Eventually, after selling the film rights in a multi-million dollar deal, DC Comics agreed to pay Siegel and Shuster 20,000 dollars a year for life and include their names in the credits of all future Superman publications.
            Mr Meltzer notes that Mitchell Siegel's death remains a mystery. "To this day, half the family was told it was a heart attack, while the other half says it was a murder," he notes on his website. But he remains convinced of its importance.
            "And why did the world get Superman? Because a little boy named Jerry Siegel heard his father was murdered and, in grief, created a bulletproof man."
